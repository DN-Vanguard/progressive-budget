# Progressive-Budget

## Description
Being able to control your finances is always difficult. In this scenario, I travel frequently and dont always have access to internet.
Due to the lack of connection, I'm not sure if I am overspending on my finances or not. With the app being able to work offline, I dont
have to rely on an internet connection to track my finances! Check out the app and see for yourself!
